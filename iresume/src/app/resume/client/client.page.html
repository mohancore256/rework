      <p class="cardContentSubmenuContent">The University of California, Davis (UC Davis), is a public research university and land-grant University
        adjacent to Davis, California. The institution was founded as a branch in 1905 and became its own separate
        entity in 1959. Founded as primarily an agricultural campus, the university has expanded over the past century
        to include graduate and professional programs in medicine (which includes the UC Davis Medical Center), law,
        veterinary medicine, education, nursing, and business management, in addition to 90 research programs offered by
        UC Davis Graduate Studies. It is part of the University of California system and has the third-largest
        enrollment in the system.
        UC Davis has a program called Supply Chain Management to streamline the way the university receives invoices
        from suppliers and it could save your department money. The campus claims to be noted for its top-rated
        Agricultural and Resource Economics programs and the large Department of Animal Science through which students
        can study at the university's own on-campus dairy, meat-processing plant, equestrian facility, and experimental
        farm.
